# LinkedIn Learning

This repository contains certificates associated with my completed LinkedIn Learning courses. Starting off, I'm uploading certificates obtained after 2020-12-01. I first began obtaining certificates of completion from Lynda.com (before Lynda was purchased by LinkedIn). I haven't uploaded those, as they are not as well-organized.

Though this repository isn't composed of code, being that I work through code-based courses using GitHub, it seems appropriate to evidence my completion of this coursework here.
